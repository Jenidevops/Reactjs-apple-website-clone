## ✨ About This Project  

🚀 **A stunning, pixel-perfect clone of Apple's official website** — built using **React + Vite + TailwindCSS**.  
💻 Designed to be **blazing fast**, **responsive across all devices**, and **developer-friendly**.  
🔗 Every link navigates to real Apple product pages, giving a near-authentic experience.  

This project isn’t just a clone — it’s a showcase of **modern frontend engineering**, attention to detail, and best practices in **UI/UX**.
